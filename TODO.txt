- fix braid update without a mirror name

- handle cases when mirror directory is missing on disc
  Example:
    braid mirror blah
    rm -rf blah
    git update blah # => borked
    # it should exit and recommend using braid fetch to grab the mirror

- delete doesn't work for binary files
  idea:
    - use Open4 to grab stderr when doing svn cat
    - if the file isn't in the repo when doing svn cat, it was deleted, else it was added or changed

- crash when svn server is not available

  idea:
    - use Open4 to grab stderr and exit code from the svn call to handle this properly

- handle cases when mirror directory is missing on disc
  Example:
    braid mirror blah
    rm -rf blah
    git update blah # => borked
    # it should exit and recommend using braid fetch to grab the mirror

- needs more progress info

- handle cases when files are missing on disc. does patch exit and applies only half of the patch?
  idea:
    - most likely using Open4 to check the output of patch would catch this
    - ideally we should ignore missing files because most likely the git user removed them but they still receive updates in the remote svn

- add braid outdated to check for remote updates to mirrors

- add braid lock/unlock so that mirrors can be skipepd during the global update

- add mercurial, darcs, etc to braid as sources and hosts
