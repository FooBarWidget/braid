* add braid setup to set up remotes and merges on other clones of your repo
  * consider requiring the braid/track branch to be pushed for this to work

* allow updating to older revisions
  * implementation idea:
    git update --revision XX or git update --commit HASH
      # svn
      git svn find-rev rXX # #{SHA1}
      # git
      # use git log to find a commit

      # updating
      # i'd rather not want to use read-tree because this would mess with all the automatic merges and stuff
      # it'll make goin back in the future harder too
      # another idea i have is to do something like rebase
      #   - stash away the change to the mirror
      #   - remake the merge form the lower revision
      #   - reapply the stashed changes

      git read-tree --prefix=#{local_branch}.tmp -u #{SHA1}
      cp -r #{local_branch}.tmp/* #{local_branch}/
      rm #{local_branch}.tmp
      git reset --mixed

* add braid lock/unlock so that mirrors can be skipepd during the global update

* add braid outdated to check for remote updates to mirrors

* add braid switch to change the remote for a mirror
  * for svn, an idea is here:

  * for git, some freaky merging i guess :)
    welp!
