reported by chrissturm:
- needs more progress info

- delete doesn't work for binary files
  idea:
    - use Open3 to grab stderr when doing svn cat
    - if the file isn't in the repo, it was deleted, else it was added or changed

- crash when svn server is not available

  idea:
    - use system instead of `` to be able to catch return code
    - however, this makes us to lose the output. better use Open3
